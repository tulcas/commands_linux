Use Linux rsync Command to copy a folder
rsync -av /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
rsync -av /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/source/

To backup my home directory, which consists of large files and mail folders to /media/backup, enter:
rsync -avz /home/vivek /media/backup


I can copy a folder to remote machine called server1.cyberciti.biz as follows:
$ rsync -avz /home/vivek/ server1.cyberciti.biz:/home/backups/vivek/
